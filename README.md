# Personal research plan for doctoral studies

Outline

My research explores the use and applicability of decentralized ledger technologies on creating socio-technical systems to alleviate commons-related governance challenges. I am particularly interested in investigating how Ostrom's design principles (Ostrom 1990, 2010) for sustainable self-governing systems can be applied to designing scalable governance systems in the distributed ledger technology (DLT) space.
